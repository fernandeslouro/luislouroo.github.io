## Military Vehicle Restoration (Esarco 6x6)

### Mechanical Treatment
The The Chassie was sandbasted and the most corrupted iron plates were replaced.
The engine was working perfectly, just needed to be clean. The eletrical systems was renovated, and the majority of the main systems needed maintnance and cleaning.vehicle was in rust condition presenting fails in all main systems. The top structure was previuosly adapted. 

**Acquired skills** 
- Mechanical systems related to cars
- Time management and organization duo to the complexity and number of components



### Design and Analysis

To obtain the final hood design I conducted an iterative process.
Since all the heaviest systems are located in the front of the car some weight need to be added to the back of the vehicle. In order to know how muchweight was needed I conduct a FEM analysis simulating the overall mass of the car and applying forces in the bottom part.
